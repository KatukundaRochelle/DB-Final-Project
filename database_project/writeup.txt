The database project is a database that stores information about a hospital, that is, patients, doctors, fees to be paid for the treatment offered, departments in which patients are taken when admitted and the fields in which the doctors specialize.
In our relational database, the information is broken down into different tables in order to reduce data redundancy.
The tables in the relational database include:
A patients table that shows the patient_id(p_id), patient_name(p_name), gender, age and p_department(p_dept) where the patients are admitted according to their illness.
A doctors table that shows the doctor_id(d_id), doctor_name(d_name) and field in which they work, that is, department.
An admission table that shows the admission_id(ad_id), p_department(p_dept) in which the patient is admitted and fee to be paid after the treatment is administered.
A treatment table that shows the patient_id(p_id), doctor_id(d_id) and admission_id(ad_id).
The treatment table acts as the join table in this relational database.
